# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Data Pipeline for Corpus Ingestion
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the data ingestion and preprocessing pipeline to transform the secured training corpus into model-ready format.
# Details:
Create ETL scripts using Python to handle the following steps:
1. Ingest raw text from the secured corpus
2. Clean and normalize text (remove duplicates, fix encoding issues)
3. Tokenize content using the tokenizer matching the selected base model
4. Split data into appropriate formats for fine-tuning (Q&A pairs or continuous text)
5. Implement data versioning using DVC or similar tool
6. Create validation checks to ensure data quality
7. Set up storage for intermediate processed data

Implementation should use libraries like pandas for data manipulation, Hugging Face's tokenizers for processing, and include proper error handling. The pipeline should be modular to allow for future extensions (e.g., incorporating external knowledge bases).

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify data integrity by comparing record counts between raw and processed data
2. Run validation tests to ensure no data corruption during processing
3. Check tokenization quality on sample texts
4. Validate that the output format matches the requirements for model training
5. Test the versioning system by creating multiple data versions
6. Measure processing time and resource usage to establish performance baselines
