# Task ID: 2
# Title: Select and Configure Base Model
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Choose an appropriate open-source transformer architecture compatible with the 48GB VRAM constraint and prepare it for fine-tuning.
# Details:
1. Evaluate candidate models (LLaMA, Mistral, or similar) based on:
   - Parameter count (targeting ~7B parameters to fit in 48GB VRAM)
   - Domain relevance and performance on similar tasks
   - License compatibility
   - Community support and documentation

2. Set up the model loading infrastructure using Hugging Face's Transformers library
3. Configure FP16 precision to optimize memory usage
4. Implement memory optimization techniques like gradient accumulation
5. Prepare LoRA or other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods if needed
6. Document model selection rationale and configuration details

Code should include proper error handling for out-of-memory scenarios and validation that the model loads correctly with the specified precision settings.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify model loads successfully with FP16 precision
2. Measure memory usage to confirm it stays within the 48GB limit
3. Run basic inference tests to ensure the model produces coherent outputs
4. Benchmark inference speed
5. Test compatibility with the Hugging Face Trainer API
6. Validate that optimization techniques (LoRA, etc.) are properly implemented
